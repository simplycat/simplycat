- 👋 Hi, I’m Cat Allen
- 👀 I’m interested in data privacy, emerging web technologies, product marketing.
- I'm a newcomer to InfoSec, NetSec and Zero Trust Network Access.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build things with groovy new headless CMS', optimized for speed and built for longevity. Whiplash fast, privacy respecting microsites are the wave of the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that are trying to make the world a better place.
- 📫 Let's collaborate: allendigital@protonmail.com
