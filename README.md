- 👋 Hi, I’m Cat Allen
- 👀 I’m interested in data privacy, emerging web technologies, product marketing, infoSec, netSec and Zero Trust Network Access.
- 🌱 I’m currently building sites optimized for speed, simplicity and usability in JAMstack. Whiplash fast, privacy respecting microsites are the wave of the future. I'm also getting back to my roots with Ruby on Rails - and loving the adventure so far.
